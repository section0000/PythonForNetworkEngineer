		How to run your script without keeping terminal opened
Use "nohup" in Linux
Ex:
   [root@section0000 Logging]# nohup python3 Test.py

By default, it will create a new file in the current directory called nohup.out. You can change that by forward the 
   output to "null"
   [root@section0000 Logging]# nohup python3 Test.py > /dev/null 

You can display its process ID by adding "&" to the end of the command
   [root@section0000 Logging]# nohup python3 Test.py > /dev/null &
