 session.connect(hostname=host,
                 username=username,
                 password=password,
                )

If you don't have any key files in <Path>/.ssh/, this works fine.
But, if you have at least 1 key file there, even though it's not exact key you desire to use, you must set look_for_keys
   parameter to false. Otherwise, you will get "Authentication failed" although you have typed password correctly

 session.connect(hostname=host,
                 username=username,
                 password=password,
              	 look_for_keys=False
                )
